# Portfolio Assistant — Roadmap

## What is this app?

**Portfolio Assistant** is a mobile app for UK GP registrars (ST1–ST3) to capture clinical learning experiences by voice after clinics, convert them via AI into structured portfolio entries, and export them as PDFs for FourteenFish submission.

**Core loop:** Voice capture → AI conversation → structured portfolio entry → review/edit → PDF export → track PDP actions

## Explicitly Out of Scope (MVP)

- Push notifications / reminders
- Direct FourteenFish API integration
- Real-time collaboration / supervisor access
- WebSocket/SSE for live updates (polling is sufficient)
- Offline support
- Multi-specialty support (GP only for MVP)
- Onboarding walkthrough
- Advanced analytics / charts
- Attachment uploads (photos, documents)
